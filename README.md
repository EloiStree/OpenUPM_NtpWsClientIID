# OpenUPM: Websocket Client IID


Welcome! If youâ€™re here, it means youâ€™re learning about the IID format and planning to build your own client in Unity3D.

You can either use a community server or create your own server at home with a Raspberry Pi.  
(_Feel free to reach out if you need help learning how to set up a server! ðŸ™Œ_)

Check out this OpenUPM package I designed:
